## I like building beautiful, useless things.

^ What does that even mean? I've only been working on hardware for a year.

### I got inspired at an art museum.

^- Jean Tinguely
^- Swiss, 60s/70s
^- Art NOT about standing in a sterile white space, distantly gazing silent painting
^- Art meant to be playful
^- He made machines produce art themselves
^- Large installations meant to be triggered by a viewer
^- Interested in making art interactive w/ viewer
^- Therefore Blurring line artist/viewer

> I wanted something ephemeral that would pass like a falling star...The work had to just transpire, make people dream and talk, and that would be all.
> -- Jean Tinguely

^- When I was at the exhibit, this quote stood out to me.
^- Really liked idea of a temporary experience that connects artist and viewer
^-It's spontaneous and,
^- Only meant to bring joy
^- Inspire for short time
