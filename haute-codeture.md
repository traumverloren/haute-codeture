# Hi, I'm Stephanie.

* Frontend Developer @ [Werkspot](https://werkspot.nl)

- Organizer of [Stupid Hackathon Amsterdam](http://www.stupidhackathon.wtf)

^I live in Amsterdam.
^Dev for a total 3 years, last yr as a frontend/js dev
^Frontend dev @ werkspot
^Organizer of Stupid Hackathon Amsterdam

## I like building<br/>useless (but joyful) things.

^You should know, I've only been working with hardware for the past year.
^And I didn't get into hardware cuz I had a project in mind to automate some part of my life or even cuz I saw something cool someone made on twitter.

---

### I got inspired at an art museum.

^I got into hardware cuz I got inspire by a visit to an art museum.
^Stedelijk museum in Amsterdam
^I went to see an exhibition of art by Jean Tinguely.

![original](tinguely.jpg)

^- Jean Tinguely
^- Swiss, 60s/70s
^- Art NOT about standing in a sterile white space, distantly gazing silent painting
^- Art meant to be playful
^- He made machines produce art themselves
^- Large installations meant to be triggered by a viewer
^- Interested in making art interactive w/ viewer
^- Therefore Blurring line artist/viewer

---

> I wanted something ephemeral that would pass like a falling star...The work had to just transpire, make people dream and talk, and that would be all.
> -- Jean Tinguely

^- When I was at the exhibit, this quote stood out to me.
^- Really liked idea of a temporary experience that connects artist and viewer
^-It's spontaneous and,
^- Only meant to bring joy
^- Inspire for short time

---

# My first project

![inline loop](react-native-demo.mp4)

^I was so inspired by the exhibit, that I was inspired to tackle hardware for the first time and build my own version for pixel art.
^Person creates a pixel art design on a web app
^Sends it to my raspberry pi
^Shows up on my rpi in my living room

---

# My first project

![inline](rpi-pixel-diagram.png)

^React app, socketio server, rpi
^Users create pixel art designs on the react web app
^Sent to the socketio server deployed on heroku
^then sent to raspberry pi and shows up on my pi in my living room!

^I gave my first conf talk last year about this project.
^You can check out the project, or my slides, or video.
^Really inspired by the reaction to my pixel art project
^Started thinking how I can take the experience out of my living room.

## What if

## I made my clothing

## the canvas?

^Taking this same idea and transferring it to my clothing

---

![fit](led-couture-schema2.png)

^User picks a program
^Send that info to a server
^that sends it to arduino and leds in my clothing

## _*Building stuff is all about*_ iteration

---

[.build-lists: true]

# Project Plan:

* Web app for user input
* LEDs + microcontroller in clothing
* Way to relay message from app to clothing

^Create web app for users
^Integrate LEDS and microcontroller into clothing pieces
^and a way to send programs from web to clothing

---

[.build-lists: true]

# Hardware

* Beginner friendly
* Small footprint
* Durability
* Wifi connectivity

^Must be as discrete/small as possible in my clothing

---

[.build-lists: true]

![left 80%](huzzah.jpg)

# Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266

* Small
* Wifi built-in
* Lots of info/tutorials

^I chose this arduino.
^it's small, has built-in wifi
^very popular microchip so lots of info online

---

[.build-lists: true]

# Talk to my clothes

## Socket.IO

* Used it in my Raspberry Pi art project
* Already knew that it works
* Easy setup: node.js server & client libraries

^I knew it worked well for my rpi pixel art
^Communicate from web app to several pieces of hardware at once

# Build process

![inline fill](iteration-1-build.jpg)![inline fill](iteration-1-build-skirt.jpg)

^so, the build process: basically me sitting on the floor in my living room of my tiny amsterdam apartment, and constructing each piece, testing, and fixing soldering mistakes lol

# First Outing: Lighted Bike Ride Amsterdam

![inline loop](bike-ride.mp4)

^So excited to take it out in public!
^But super FAIL

---

# Fail

![inline autoplay loop](sigh.mp4)

^Embarrassed, disappointed

---

# Iteration #2

### (Or, how to make it crash less)

^An opportunity to troubleshoot and make it work better

---

# Figure out where it was crashing

* Use Serial Monitor in Arduino IDE (Log statements)

![inline](serial-monitor-1.png)

^Lucky for me, the microcontroller i chose supports monitoring when plugged into my computer
^put in log statements at all diff bits of the code

---

# Figure out where it was crashing

* Use Serial Monitor in Arduino IDE (Log statements)

![inline](serial-monitor-2.png)

^very clear was crashing cuz the internet was disconnecting and reconnecting over and over again

---

## Flaky connection

# <br>

# 🤔

^got me thinking...

---

### _Socket.IO is_ great _for the web!_

### _but is the_ best _fit for my IoT Project?_

^Made for web applications communicated over HTTP
^Geared for browsers, but I didn't need that extra overhead

---

### Just because a library is available, doesn't mean it's the best solution

^So i took a step back and thought again about what i was up against coding for hardware.

---

[.build-lists: true]

# Coding for Hardware

* Resources are at a premium
* Minimize overhead

^Not communicating between browser and server for my hardware, so that extra overhead for HTTP isn't needed.

---

## What else can I use?

# <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

---

## What else can I use?

# <br>

## ✨ MQTT ✨

^M2M/IoT connectivity protocol
^Born in 1999, where needed a solution that allowed for minimal battery loss and minimal bandwidth connecting oil pipelines over satellite connection.

---

# Publish/subscribe

![inline](mqtt-pubsub-diagram.png)

^Consists of clients and a broker.
^Clients connect to the broker, which then mediates communication between the two devices.
^Each device can subscribe, or register, to particular topics.
^When another client publishes a message on a subscribed topic, the broker forwards the message to any client that has subscribed.
^Space decoupling: Publisher and subscriber do not need to know each other
^Time decoupling: Publisher and subscriber do not need to run at the same time.
^Synchronization decoupling: Operations on both components are not halted during publish or receiving

---

[.build-lists: true]

# Lightweight

* Transport over TCP/IP
* 2 byte overhead

^MQTT control packet headers are kept as small as possible. Each control packet has a specific purpose and every bit in the packet is carefully crafted to reduce the data transmitted over the network. Each MQTT control packet consist of three parts, a fixed header, variable header and payload. Each MQTT control packet has a 2 byte Fixed header. Not all the control packet have the variable headers and payload. A variable header contains the packet identifier if used by the control packet. A payload up to 256 MB could be attached in the packets. Having a small header overhead makes this protocol appropriate for IoT by lowering the amount of data transmitted over constrained networks.

---

[.build-lists: true]

# Flexible

* Data agnostic payload

---

[.build-lists: true]

# Reliable

* Quality of Service (QoS) levels
* Offline messaging
* Retained messages

^QoS: agreement between sender and receiver of a message regarding the guarantees of delivering a message (At most once, at least once, exactly once)
^QoS is a major feature of MQTT, it makes communication in unreliable networks a lot easier because the protocol handles retransmission and guarantees the delivery of the message, regardless how unreliable the underlying transport is
^Hook up a DB: Persistent session means even if the client is offline all the above will be stored by the broker and are available right after the client reconnects.

### Relying on a small external broker service...

### **not optimal**

^Too many unknowns: great for prototyping but relying on for my whole project, too risky.

# Build a MQTT Broker

* Need access to port 1883
* Heroku → Digital Ocean

IMPLEMENT THE MQTT BROKER

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const path = require("path");
const aedes = require("aedes")();
const mqttServer = require("net").createServer(aedes.handle);
const httpServer = require("http").createServer(app);
const ws = require("websocket-stream");
const mqttPort = 1883;
const appPort = 8080;

mqttServer.listen(mqttPort, function() {});
httpServer.listen(appPort, function() {});

ws.createServer({ server: httpServer }, aedes.handle);
```

# Final thoughts

^It can take many iterations to get something right or where you want it to be and that's ok. I messed a bunch during this with trying to figure out devops and doing sloppy soldering, and it was super frustrating, but it all helped me learn and improve my skills.
